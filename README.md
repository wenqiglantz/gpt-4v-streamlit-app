# Web Application Interface

This project presents a prototype design and implementation of a web application interface. The application features a simple yet intuitive UI including a navigation sidebar with logo, page content with a title, a data table, and a bar chart.

## Prerequisites

Before running this web application, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't already have Python, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installing Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. To install Streamlit, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

After you have Streamlit installed, you can start building your app.

## Interface Description

The interface, as depicted in the sketch and mockup, includes the following components:

- **Logo**: Positioned at the top of a sidebar, representing the brand.
- **Navigation Links**: 'About Us', 'Products', 'Pricing', and a dropdown that defaults to 'Option 1'.
- **Page Title**: A clear, descriptive title for the current page view.
- **Data Table**: A neatly organized table to display data with column and row headers.
- **Bar Chart**: A graphical representation of data with bars of varying heights.

## Running the App

With Streamlit installed, navigate to your app's directory in the terminal and execute:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deployment

Streamlit apps can be easily deployed on various platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Streamlit Sharing.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, and any feedback or suggestions are appreciated as we look to improve the interface and functionality.
